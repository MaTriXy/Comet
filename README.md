# Comet

This is Comet. A new, free to use Icon Pack developed by James Fenn and designed by Brice Seibert. Thanks for taking a look. 

If you're reading this, just know that I want a burrito. Burritos are great. Burritos are really a good creation. Just remember that you're a part of the human race and humans are those guys that invented burritos so they're cool and all. Yup.

### Download
